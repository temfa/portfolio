                I am a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in front end development (React.js & Next.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and
                visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began my journey as a web developer in 2018, and since then, I have continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest
                technologies along the way.5 years after starting my web development journey, I am building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js,
                TypeScript, Javascript, React and much more.
              </p>
              <p>I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.</p>
              <p>
                When I am not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some
                free time. You can follow me on Twitter where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.
              </p>
              <p>Finally, some quick bits about me.</p>
              <p>One last thing, I am available for freelance work, so feel free to reach out and say hello! I promise I dont bite ðŸ˜‰</p>
